Hi! I'm a Postdoc at Stanford, working in Medical AI and Computer Vision ([MARVL])(https://marvl.stanford.edu). 

I'm interested in all aspects of Computer Vision, particularly video understanding and 3D human mesh recovery, as well as its applications to life sciences. In my current work, I focus on using computer vision approaches to understand the human condition, and look into applications such as parent-child interactions and patient triaging.
