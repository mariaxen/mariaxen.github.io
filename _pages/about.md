Hi! I'm a Postdoc at Stanford, working in Medical AI and Computer Vision ([MARVL](https://marvl.stanford.edu)), advised by Serena Yeung. In my current work, I focus on using computer vision approaches to understand the human condition, and look into applications such as exploring parent-child interactions and triaging patients using video. 

I'm interested in all aspects of Computer Vision, particularly video understanding and 3D human mesh recovery, as well as its applications to life sciences. 

Previously I worked on predictive ML models for multiomics and integrating data from multiple sources to develop better ML models for water demand forecasting.
